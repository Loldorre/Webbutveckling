            <img alt="Old picture of Dorians Steakhouse" src="/bilder/dorians%20steakhouse.jpg">

            <p>Dorians Steakhouse was opened in the early 1900s by a man named Dorian. He was a skilled butcher and had a passion for cooking
                delicious steaks. He started the steakhouse with the help of his family and it quickly became a local favorite.
            </p>
                </br>
            <p>
                As the years passed, Dorian passed the steakhouse down to his children and then to his grandchildren. Each generation put their
                own unique touch on the restaurant, but they always stayed true to Dorian's original vision of serving high-quality steaks
                cooked to perfection.
                </br>
                During World War II, Dorians Steakhouse remained open and became a popular spot for soldiers on leave. They were known for
                their hearty meals, and it was a place where soldiers could relax and forget about the war for a little while.
